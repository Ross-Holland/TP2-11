TEAM 11!
Functioning e-commerce platform selling a variety of shoes to consumers. 

The target audience of our store and products is everyone, as everyone needs shoes! Some categories of shoes we will be selling, but not limited to are: mens, womens and childrens, to allow us to meet our target market of everyone. When visiting the website, a user will be able to login or register an account before browsing the website to help protect our products, prices and features from competitors. While browsing, customers will be able to find any of our products they may be looking for using the navigation bar provided on our pages. Once chosen, they can choose to add the products to their wishlist or official cart where they can check out and purchase the products. 

We are using a combination of: HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript to create our ecommerce platform. On top of this we are planning to use standalone Java to create our Java project for our admin controls. The website is deployed and uses a deployed database to control our products and customer orders.

Our website has been hosted locally and our database has not been deployed because of this, to host our website locally please go to the dbsc.sql file in our code and run the blocks of SQL commands in PHPMYADMIN.
